The sun has a yellowish-orange hue, while the sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface is mostly in the red and orange regions of the spectrum. In this region, it absorbs blue light and reflects other colors. Blue light contains about 1/230th the amount of energy as red light, so it reflects off objects more than does red light. As a result, the sky appears blue due to the reflection of blue light in the atmosphere.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[529,29989,5205,29989,29958,13,3492,526,263,8444,319,29902,20255,29889,2,29871,13,29966,29989,1792,29989,29958,13,11008,14744,338,7254,29973,2,29871,13,29966,29989,465,22137,29989,29958,13,1576,2927,310,7254,29892,607,25618,2737,304,408,376,7912,1699,338,8581,491,278,10296,310,17977,2580,322,25312,7254,3578,7371,491,278,11563,29915,29879,25005,29889,450,6575,756,263,8007,645,13447,845,29899,2207,865,29872,22888,29872,29892,1550,278,6575,4366,393,22170,278,11563,29915,29879,7101,338,11149,297,278,2654,322,21481,865,29872,12786,310,278,18272,29889,512,445,5120,29892,372,17977,5824,7254,3578,322,9432,29879,916,11955,29889,10924,3578,3743,1048,29871,29896,29914,29906,29941,29900,386,278,5253,310,5864,408,2654,3578,29892,577,372,9432,29879,1283,3618,901,1135,947,2654,3578,29889,1094,263,1121,29892,278,14744,5692,7254,2861,304,278,17842,310,7254,3578,297,278,25005,29889],"total_duration":15146254728,"load_duration":1058992932,"prompt_eval_count":39,"prompt_eval_duration":2149488000,"eval_count":134,"eval_duration":11933835000}
